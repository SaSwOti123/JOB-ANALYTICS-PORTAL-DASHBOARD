**This project involves creating three complex charts based on specific conditions using job posting data. The first chart compares roles, job titles, and postings filtered by date, work type, company name, job portal, and country. The second chart compares preferences and work types, considering geographic and time-based constraints, as well as job title length and company size. The third chart identifies the top 20 companies with the most "User Experience Designer" roles and "UI/UX Designer" job titles, focusing on company name length.**
